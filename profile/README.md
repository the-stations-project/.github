# The Stations Project
A minimalist local WebSocket-based cloud.

NOT YET USABLE, please be patient

## Notes
- A station should run on linux
- A station uses actual user accounts on the server, using useradd and userdel commands
- For use in larger contexts, consider using a VM or a dedicated server
